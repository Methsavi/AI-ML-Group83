Continuous User Authentication Using Sensor-Based Neural Networks
<hr>
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on continuous user authentication using sensor data collected from smart devices such as accelerometers and gyroscopes. The raw sensor readings are first cleaned and normalized, then divided into time-based segments where important features are extracted from both time and frequency domains. These features are used to train a neural network model that learns unique motion patterns of each user and verifies identity based on behavior instead of passwords. The system is evaluated using metrics such as FAR, FRR, and EER to measure authentication accuracy and reliability. This coursework demonstrates how machine learning and behavioral biometrics can be applied to improve security while maintaining user convenience.
