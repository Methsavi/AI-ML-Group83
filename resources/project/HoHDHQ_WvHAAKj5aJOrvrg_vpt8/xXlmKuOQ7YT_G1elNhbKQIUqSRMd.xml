<Info description="This project explores the fundamentals and practical applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) using MATLAB. It focuses on implementing key concepts such as data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization. Through this project, we aim to understand how algorithms learn from data, make predictions, and adapt to different problem domains.&#10;&#10;The repository includes MATLAB scripts and live scripts that demonstrate various AI/ML techniques — from simple linear regression to more advanced classification and clustering models. It serves as a learning-based implementation project for our university module on AI &amp; Machine Learning, helping us apply theoretical knowledge in a hands-on environment."/>
